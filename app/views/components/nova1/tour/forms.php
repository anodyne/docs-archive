<h1>Nova Tour: Dynamic Forms</h1>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span3">
		<p>Let's face it, no two RPGs are alike, so why should the forms they use be the same for all of them? We think they shouldn't, so we've created an easy-to-use system that lets you customize the bio/join, docking request, specs and tour forms to exactly how you want them!</p>
		
		<p>Driven completely out of the database, the new dynamic forms give admins the ultimate control all from a handful of pages in the Control Panel.</p>
