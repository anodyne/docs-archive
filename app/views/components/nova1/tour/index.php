<h1>Take a Tour</h1>

<p>In many regards, Nova represents a quantum leap forward from SMS. Gone are the days of walking on egg shells to modify the core or having to put up with icons that may not fit in your skin. Gone are the days of having multiple accounts for multiple characters and have limits on the number of people you can write a joint post with. Gone are the days of struggling to modify the join form to do exactly what you want. Nova represents an impressive evolution from SMS that puts the power back with game masters and lets them get back to the game.</p>
