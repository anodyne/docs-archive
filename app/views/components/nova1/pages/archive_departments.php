<p>While we've gone to great lengths to make the upgrade process as seamless and accurate as possible, there's no way for it to 100% accurate for 100% of the sims using it. Because of that, we've created an item in the archive section for viewing departments from the SMS tables. This will help admins manually transfer their departments from the SMS table to Nova.</p>

<p>From the archive index, simply click on the departments link and you'll be shown the listing of all departments out the SMS table. The listing will display the name and description of each department in the SMS tables.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note:</strong> Unless you've made no changes whatsoever to the SMS departments, you will need to manually make changes to your departments.</p>
