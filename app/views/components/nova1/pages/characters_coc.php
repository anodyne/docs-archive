<p>The chain of command is a visual representation of the in-character (and perhaps out of character as well) order of seniority. Nova allows both played character as well as non-played characters to be shown in the chain of command listing. Managing the order of the list is both incredibly simple as well as intuitive.</p>

<h2>Adding to the Chain of Command</h2>

<p>You can add a character to the chain of command by selecting their name from the dropdown menu and clicking add. Nova utilizes AJAX technology to transparently update the database and update the listing below the dropdown menu. Once the character has been added, a new box with their name will fade in at the bottom of the list. The dropdown menu is broken up into played characters and non-played characters. Once you have added a character to the list, you can change their order or remove them.</p>

<h2>Re-Ordering the Chain of Command</h2>

<p>You can change the order of the chain of command by simply clicking and holding on the gray box with the character's name and dragging it up or down to the position you want. Proceed to re-order the list until you're satisfied, then click update. Like adding a character to the list, Nova uses AJAX to seamlessly update the database without the need to refresh your page.</p>

<h2>Removing from the Chain of Command</h2>

<p>Removing a character from the chain of command is as simple as clicking the X on the right side of the gray box with their name. Nova will go out to the database and remove them from the list then fade the box with their name out of view.</p>
