<p>Over the coming months, Anodyne will be transitioning some of the content from Anodyne wiki over to a static group of tutorials and FAQs about SMS. By the time Nova launches in 2010, we'll have the necessary tutorials and content completely moved and will be able to remove the wiki altogether. Please let us know if there's something pressing we've missed or you'd like to see.</p>

<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<p>We are pleased to be able to make a wide array of tutorials available for people curious about Nova and developing for it. The tutorials cover many different topics and are a fairly comprehensive look at their particular subject matter. Requests for additional tutorials should be done on the <a href="http://forums.anodyne-productions.com" target="_blank">Anodyne forums</a>.</p>
