<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q1 2008</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the first quarter of 2008 covering the period between <dfn>1 January</dfn> and <dfn>31 March</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>Anodyne's focus during the first quarter rested entirely on continued development of SMS 2.6. At the quarter's close, we were coming closer and closer to feature completion and moving into the beta phase. In the end though, the 2.6 release has become a much larger release than we'd originally planned. While that isn't a bad thing, hopefully it helps explain why it's taken so long to deliver it. We fully anticipate shipping the first SMS 2.6 beta by the end of the second quarter with a likely gold master and product launch during the third quarter. More information on that timeframe will be released as we get closer.</p>

<p>SMS 2.6 is a refinement release, taking many of the key features from SMS 2.5 and making them much better. A few weeks ago, Anodyne launched the SMS First Look section of the website where we're providing a myriad of information about the upcoming release, including a partial feature list. A complete feature list will be released once 2.6 goes into beta so that users can know what to look forward to. One disappointing development though was the fact that we had to drop the private messaging CC feature. It was something we wanted to accomplish, but in the end, it was just too hard to develop it given the private messaging framework that's in place right now. This feature has been moved forward to SMS 3.</p>

<p>Anodyne has been more vocal in the last few weeks about SMS 3 and some of the things the new CodeIgniter framework gives us in terms of features and expandability. Once SMS 2.6 is release, lots of more information will be released and more definitive timelines will be outlined. For the most up-to-date information about SMS 3, please make sure to check out our development blog.</p>
