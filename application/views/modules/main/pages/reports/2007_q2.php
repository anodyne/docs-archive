<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q2 2007</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the second quarter of 2007 covering the period between <dfn>1 April</dfn> and <dfn>30 June</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>The second quarter has seen a dramatic increase in attention on the 2.5 release. All in all, we're up to somewhere around 1500 code changes since SMS 2.4.4. Since Q1, we have pushed out two beta releases and have patched all subsequent bugs associated with those releases. Currently, the release candidate has been in the hands of the QA team for the last week and a half with only a couple issues being reported. It is likely we'll push out a revised RC in the next few days to ensure QA testers are using the latest possible code. Anodyne will release SMS 2.5 on Tuesday, July 24, 2007, marking the 1-year anniversary of SMS 2's release. Along with the SMS 2.5 release, Anodyne will also be unveiling several new initiatives that we hope will greatly aid the Anodyne community.</p>

<p>We are all very excited about the 2.5 release as it represents a significant step forward and opens up the door for more exciting things in the coming months. It is our goal to release any subsequent 2.5 patches and the final 2.6 release by the end of Q3 2007, followed by the final 2.7 release during Q4 2007. SMS 2.7 will be the final SMS 2 release, after which, SMS3 development will begin starting in Q1 2008. There is currently no projected release timeframe for SMS3.</p>

<h2>Fleet Management System</h2>

<p>Unfortunately there isn't a lot more to report with FMS. There is still no Project Leader available for the project, so it's indefinitely stalled. There's recently been a surging effort for people to get their hands on FMS1. Anodyne has officially stopped supporting the product and will not distribute it for people to use. If you know someone who has a copy, you can get it from them, but public distribution of of FMS1 without prior consent of Anodyne is prohibited. As more information becomes available on the project, we'll let the community know.</p>

<h2>AcademiA</h2>

<p>We regret to inform the community that AcademiA development has come to a close for the time being. A variety of factors went into the decision, but ultimately, in the end, it was Jon Matterson's decision and one that Anodyne supports at this time. In the future, we may start development back up, but for now, the project has been shelved.</p>

<h2>AnodyneBB</h2>

<p>Due to the size of the AnodyneBB project, no new information is being released at this time. As we draw closer to a working product, we will bring that information to the community.</p>

<h2>New Anodyne Staff</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce the addition of Justin Chow as Anodyne's first Graphic Designer! Justin brings a wealth of knowledge and a keen design eye to the team and has already made his mark on SMS. The 2.5 release will ship with Justin's SMS Lcars skin, the first time the project's developer hasn't developed all the skins released with the product. We're excited for his designs and the possibilities that they bring for the future. As more projects are added, Justin will play an integral part in helping the applications look as good as possible.</p>
