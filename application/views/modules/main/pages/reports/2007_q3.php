<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q3 2007</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the third quarter of 2007 covering the period between <dfn>1 July</dfn> and <dfn>30 September</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>Only three and a half weeks into the third quarter, Anodyne released SMS 2.5 to the community, further continuing the evolution of the most popular RPG manager. Included in the release were a slew of new features that included database-driven menus, a new user access control system, improved efficiency and over a dozen bug fixes. The release was extremely anticipated and we had people "lining up" to get a copy of it the night it was released. The launch wasn't without problems as several patches were released in the first seven days, but after stabilizing the branch, people have been responding extremely positively to the release.</p>

<p>Moving into the future, Anodyne is taking a new approach to development and releases. Gone are the days of announcing a release timeframe. Instead, we're going to work on releases until they're ready to go, then push them out. Because of this, previous timelines for versions 2.6 and 2.7 are out. Initial planning has begun on SMS 2.6, but development hasn't begun in earnest yet. Features for the last two releases of SMS 2.x have nearly been finalized at this point.</p>

<p>During the third quarter, we also began to solidify plans for the next major version of SMS, codenamed SMS3. Like SMS2 was to SMS1, SMS3 will represent a huge leap forward in both methodology as well as functionality. As development begins, more information will be released. To date, the only confirmed feature is multi-genre installations to expand SMS's appeal beyond Star Trek RPGs.</p>

<h2>Fleet Management System</h2>

<p>There is nothing new to report on FMS. As more information becomes available on the project, we'll let the community know.</p>

<h2>AnodyneBB</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, over the last three months we've lost contact with our AnodyneBB Project Manager. Because of this and the complete lack of work done on the project, Anodyne is officially putting AnodyneBB on the shelf. We hope this serves as a reminder of the volatility of open source development. It can be extremely tough to keep good programmers on board for more than a couple months. Additionally, situations like this highlight why Anodyne does not comment on future products this early in the development process. It's unfortunate that this project stalled, but it's the nature of open source development. If a qualified programmer steps forward, we will try to keep this project going.</p>

<h2>New Anodyne Website</h2>

<p>To coincide with the release of SMS 2.5, Anodyne rolled out a new website. Reaction has been pretty positive so far to the new site. Part of the new site is an expanded SMS Extras site which includes not only skins and ranks, but utilities and skinning resources and a couple Anodyne MODs will be released in the coming months. If you haven't checked out the new site yet, drop by and see what's new.</p>

<p>As part of the 2.5 release, the forums were updated to the latest release candidate of phpBB3 and we've also added a wiki for online documentation for Anodyne projects. There's a lot of information up there now with more going up every week. It's an excellent place to find FAQs and information about SMS and other Anodyne products.</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance Team</h2>

<p>To date, we've used a pretty simple and straightforward model for our QA team which is responsible for beta testing SMS before its release. It worked well in the early going, but we've found that we're going to need more in the way of QA testing, both for SMS as well as future Anodyne products. To that end, we've been working on a new QA structure that we're hoping to put in to place during the fourth quarter to begin using with the SMS 2.6 release. Right now, Brian Smith is the Director of QA & Product Testing. That won't change. What will change is that instead of Brian managing a large team of testers, he will manage a small group of Senior QA Specialists who will in turn manage their own group. This affords us the flexibility of staggering beta release roll-out to ensure that things are being tested to their fullest.</p>

<p>Additionally, each team will be responsible for testing the entire system, but each member will have their own area of responsibility. The hope here is that if one person is always testing, for instance, the posting features, they'll become intimately familiar with them and be able to identify problems much quicker. We're still working out the numbers, but for the SMS 2.6 beta cycle, we're looking to expand the QA team by a few people. More information will be coming in the next few weeks about that expansion effort as well as naming 2 Senior QA Specialists.</p>

<h2>Product Announcement</h2>

<p>Finally, Anodyne is pleased to announce the existence of a new product, named Janus. We're not ready to pull the covers off Janus just yet, but we wanted to put the name out there and see if we can't generate a little buzz. Expect more information on Janus in the 4th quarter report that'll be released in early January. We're all very excited about this product and we're sure you will be too!</p>
