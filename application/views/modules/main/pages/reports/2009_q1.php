<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q1 2009</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the first quarter of 2009 covering the period between <dfn>1 January</dfn> and <dfn>31 March</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<h3>SMS 2.6</h3>

<p>Work has all but wrapped up on SMS during the first quarter. A few minor issues were resolved in the trunk and will be pushed out as SMS 2.6.9 in the coming weeks, but there should be few updates in the future. We anticipate only 2 or 3 more updates before the release of Nova, one of which will be a minor update to allow SMS sims to be notified of the release of Nova.</p>

<h3>SMS 2.x Support</h3>

<p>As SMS 2 winds down and we start moving toward Nova, questions are going to come up about how we're going to support SMS 2. Details haven't been worked out yet, but at this point, we're anticipating that we'll maintain SMS 2 support for between 3 and 6 months following the release of Nova. It's important to note that when we say "maintain support" it means that we'll continue to answer questions and help people on the forums with SMS 2 issues. There's a possibility that we'll maintain SMS 2 until the release of Nova 1.1, but again, it's far too early to tell for sure. We're making a concerted effort to put the update process at the forefront with Nova, so updating from SMS 2 to Nova should be a breeze. More information will be available in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p>We're finally in the full swing of Nova's development. With 3 milestones behind us, Nova is beginning to take shape. We've gotten some good feedback so far from people who have used the development builds, so we're confident that we're moving in the right direction. Some people have requested features be added to Nova, but at this point, we're not taking any requests for 1.0. If we keep making this a moving target, we'll never release. Currently, the plan is to release Nova 1.0 when it's finished and then follow it up with 1.1 and 1.2 which will (hopefully) address some of the things people have brought up. There will be a lot more information available on the subsequent Nova updates as we get closer to release.</p>

<p>We're not going to go into all the details about what's gone in to Nova so far, but rest assured that Nova is already leaps and bounds beyond SMS, both in its ease of use, extensibility and power. We encourage people who are interested in what's going on with Nova to download a development build and install it on a live server or a local server and play around with it. There's no better way to see what's coming with Nova than to actually use it!</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<ul>
	<li>SMS was downloaded 766 times between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2009</li>
	<li><strong>SMS 2.6.2</strong> - 1</li>
	<li><strong>SMS 2.6.4</strong> - 1</li>
	<li><strong>SMS 2.6.7</strong> - 276</li>
	<li><strong>SMS 2.6.8</strong> - 488</li>
</ul>

<h2>Q2 2009</h2>

<p>We've kicked off 2009 with a bang on a few fronts. First, in mid-January, we released the first public milestone of Nova to everyone to use. Then, 6 weeks later, we release the second build to the community a full 4 weeks ahead of schedule. In the coming quarter, our focus is solely on getting milestone 4 completed. Doing so would be us beyond the halfway point in development. There will be lots of information available on the blog as well as the forums in the coming weeks and months, so make sure to stay tuned for lots of Nova stuff!</p>
