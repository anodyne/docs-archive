<h1>State of Anodyne Productions &ndash; January 2011</h1>

<p>This document serves to provide the state of Anodyne Productions and its various projects as well as lay out goals for the coming calendar year.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p>This time last year, Nova wasn't even finished and people were waiting to find out when the release date was. It's amazing how much things can change in a single year. Over the last 12 months, Anodyne has gone from a quiet company with not much to report, to a company that's again releasing information about new releases, patching bugs and releasing fixes. We're excited to have been able to push Nova 1.0 out the door and we're even more thrilled with the reception it's gotten from the community.</p>

<p>Like anything you release, there are bound to be issues, but we've addressed them as quickly as possible since mid-April. Sure, there have been people who have come out and blasted Nova for one reason or another, but generally, people have understood that this is a new product and we're working as hard as we can to make it better. Also, the community has been fully embracing some of the changes we've made over the 2 years of Nova development. It's exciting because these changes set up Anodyne for further growth with our RPG management software. Nova 1 is only the tip of the iceberg and by the close of 2011, we think people will understand where Nova is moving even more with continued focus not only on improving Nova 1, but also on previewing Nova 2.</p>

<p>Continuing our promise of progressive enhancements to Nova 1, we delivered Nova 1.2 just before Christmas. Version 1.2 is the largest update to Nova so far and we're excited to be able to offer Nova users great new features like site ban controls and multiple manifests. People have been incredibly positive and enthusiastic about these new features and are eager to really start using what we've been working on since this Fall. We've already released 3 updates to Nova 1.2 to patch bugs, and like always, we'll continue to track issues and patch issues that come up.</p>

<h3>Nova 1.3</h3>

<p>Moving forward, Nova 1.3 will focus on enhancing Thresher, Nova's built-in mini-wiki. We're still in the process of compiling the final feature list, but here are some of the things you can look forward to seeing in Thresher R2:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An all-new way of selecting wiki page categories</li>
	<li>Protections/restrictions on individual wiki pages</li>
	<li>An overhauled user experience for managing wiki pages</li>
	<li>An updated UI for wiki pages</li>
	<li>System pages</li>
	<li>Better searching of the wiki including putting a search field on the main wiki page</li>
	<li>Cleaning up old wiki page drafts</li>
</ul>

<p>Like always, some of these features could be dropped for later versions of Thresher and things could end up being added, so take the above with a grain of salt. As for other areas of improvement, here are some of the things outside of Thresher we're working on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Allowing flash messages to be included in seamless substitution (in Nova 1.2, we allowed the flash messages in the login section to be overridden, now we'll extend this to all sections)</li>
	<li>Updating some of the jQuery plugins</li>
	<li>Adding seaQuest DSV to the list of available genres</li>
	<li>Elastic textareas in several places</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to have this release out the door by the end of Q1 2011 and then begin working on Nova 1.4 for Q2 2011. More information about our progress will be available on GitHub, Twitter, Facebook and the forums.</p>

<h3>Nova 2</h3>

<p>As 2010 opened, Nova 2 was only a glimmer in our eyes, but it was clear to us that something had to be on the table after Nova 1, otherwise we'd find ourselves in a situation where we were scrambling to figure out where we wanted to go. It took weeks, even months in some cases, to figure out how we wanted to tackle the growing list of enhancements, but we managed to do it and have spent the last 9 months working toward that. Make no mistake, this is a huge development effort in the same vein as SMS to Nova 1, but like Nova 1, version 2.0 will set us up for the future.</p>

<p>So far, we've managed to release a couple milestones to showcase our progress on Nova 2. Most people would look at the milestones and think that there hasn't been much work done, but the truth is, there's been a massive amount of work done on Nova 2 already. Our mantra for 2.0 is "better and smarter." We don't want to just add features for the sake of adding features, we want to make the system better than it was before and smarter than it was before.</p>

<p>To start, we spent 6 months working on the installation/update/SMS upgrade processes alone. Why? Because those are the points of entry for Nova, those are the things you come in contact with first. People complained about how Nova 1 was more difficult to setup than SMS, and at some level, they're right. Nova 1 is far more complicated than SMS and sadly, it shows in the setup process. That wasn't acceptable moving forward though. We wanted to lower the barrier to entry and make the experience of setting up Nova 2 not only quick and easy, but also one that makes people enjoy their first interaction with Nova. The results were better than we anticipated. Nova 2's setup process is faster and more intuitive than it's ever been and even blows SMS out of the water. For anyone who hasn't tried it, make sure you grab a copy of M2 and see how easy it is to get up and running or even upgrade from SMS.</p>

<p>Nova 2's progress is steady, but certainly slower because of our continued work on Nova 1. The latest milestone, M2, doesn't offer much in the way of system functionality, but we are continuing to work on the system and port features from Nova 1 over to Nova 2, just not in the way we'd originally envisioned.</p>

<p>Starting with Nova 1, we moved to the milestone-based approach we're currently using, but with 1.0, we focused on a section of the system and then fired off a milestone for people to use. That worked well, but there were two critical flaws in that way of doing things. First, and most importantly, was tester confusion. If a milestone focused on the writing section, people undoubtedly tried to go and edit their posts and were greeted with errors and blank screens. They'd venture over to the forums and tell us that pages didn't work, a fact we were well aware of since those pages hadn't been built yet. Second, in some cases, there was a lot of inconsistency between the user-facing pages and their management pages because of the year (or more) between work on them. We watched these two things become issues over the course of development and continue to be issues with the start of Nova 2. Instead of trying to explain things to the community, we decided it was time to change the way we handled development. To that end, we've made massive changes to the milestone structure for Nova 2.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we've decided to group functionality together instead of files. What that means is that instead of developing the manifest, then a year later, developing the manifest and character management pieces, we're going do them at the same time so that we're focusing our efforts on related pieces of functionality instead of doing things randomly. This means that when M3 is released, testers will be able to do just about anything related to user and character management (there are some fringe pieces that will have to wait for a few milestones). No more error messages about missing pages that people expect to be there. It also means that testers will be able to identify issues much easier because they aren't testing the same components a year apart. We're excited about this change and have already begun to map out the next 2 or 3 milestones for which features we want to tackle. More information about Nova 2's development will be available on GitHub, Twitter, Facebook and the forums.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>As 2009 came to a close, the majority of our users knew of Nova, but it wasn't a reality for them, SMS 2 was. Now that Nova's been out for 7 and a half months, that has slowly changed. At this time last year, we'd talked about the SMS 2 support situation, but it was only a theory, nothing hard and fast. Having months of Nova under our belts, we have a much clearer picture about how we're tackling SMS 2's support now that our primary product is Nova.</p>

<p>As expected, there haven't been any updates to SMS 2, and there won't be. Starting in 2011, we consider SMS 2 a legacy product and encourage anyone still on SMS 2 to do the upgrade to Nova 1. Unlike we'd planned, we've decided to keep the SMS 2 section of the forums open for now. We're still fielding questions, but in the future, we will close down the SMS 2 section of the forums to new posts and leave them there for a purely archival purpose. We haven't decided when that will be, but we'll be sure to give plenty of notice before pulling the trigger on this one.</p>

<p>Also, because of its new status as a legacy product, SMS will be removed from future quarterly reports. Any important information will be communicated in future reports, just not in a dedicated section of the report. SMS has been a workhorse for Anodyne over the last 5 and a half years, but we feel we're approaching a point where it just isn't viable to be supporting both SMS and Nova.</p>

<h2>Anodyne Productions</h2>

<p>People can often forget that we deal with more than just Nova. There are all kinds of subsidiary sites that we maintain as well, including the AnodyneXtras, AnodyneDocs, the main site, forums and a blog (which admittedly doesn't get used as often as it could). Over the years, these sites have gotten bigger and more complex and that was never more evident than with March's launch of the new Anodyne site. We were really excited about the new site, but as we've been using it, it's clear it's way too complicated. Because of that, we're announcing a new initiative for 2011 to revamp our branding and make our sites easier to use.</p>

<p>The first place we're going to start with this the main Anodyne site. If you take a look at the site, even ignoring the Nova and SMS sections, you quickly see a main page, site history, site credits, about us, news, news archive and contact page. There's a lot of stuff to navigate through and it loses the main purpose of the site. Really, when someone hits the Anodyne site, there's nothing right now to tell them who we are or what we do. That's a problem. We want to simplify our presence and let people get in, do what they need and get out.</p>

<p>To that end, the new Anodyne site, which we're in the process of designing and building, is a single page that has 5 sections: about us, what we do, our products, news and contact us. The entire branding is much simpler and should accomplish the goal of letting people come to the site, get what they need and leave without any headaches. We haven't set any timeline on when the new site will go live, but we don't want to drag our feet too long on this though. The biggest hurdle to overcome will be the fact that the Nova and SMS pages will need to be revamped as well. Once we have those pieces in place, we'll go live. We're excited to be undertaking this task to simplify our web presence. If people have any suggestions, we'd love to hear them!</p>

<p>In closing, we want to thank the entire community and all of our users and supporters for their support during 2010. It was a seismic year for us as we moved away from our staple product and introduced a new one. 2011 promises to be an equally important year for Anodyne and we're excited to have you along for the ride with us!</p>
