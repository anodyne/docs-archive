<h1>State of Anodyne Productions &ndash; January 2010</h1>

<p>This document serves to provide the state of Anodyne Productions and its various projects as well as lay out goals for the coming calendar year.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<h3>SMS 2.6</h3>

<p>2009 was a bittersweet year in SMS-land. On the one hand, we have continued to patch bugs and released the 32nd version of SMS 2: 2.6.9. Having pushed out 32 versions of the system since 2006 is a huge accomplishment and we're proud to report that SMS' stability is at an all-time high! We've begun finalizing what will be the final SMS 2 release ever, version 2.6.10. We're hoping to have the 33rd release of SMS 2 out the door in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>This exciting milestone also marks the bitter part of 2009 for Anodyne. Since April of 2005, SMS has stood as the sole Anodyne product, but 2009 wasn't about SMS, it was about Nova and we've all had to come to grips with the fact that in a few short months, SMS will take a bow as Anodyne's flagship product. Personally, I've spent so many years working on SMS that it's sad to see it all come to an end, but I'm also very excited because of the opportunities that Nova is going to open up for Anodyne.</p>

<p>By the end of our first quarter (31 March), SMS development will officially be closed.</p>

<h3>SMS 2 Support</h3>

<p>With the upcoming release of Nova 1.0, the question of SMS 2 support has finally reached the limelight. There will no doubt be those who want to stay with SMS as long as possible before making the leap (though we think that after only a few hours with Nova, you'll agree it's the better alternative) and we don't want to simply abandon those people that have made SMS what it is today, but we've also spent a lot of time working on Nova and want to ensure all our attention is focused there. After careful consideration, we've decided that we'll keep the SMS forums open through the release of Nova 1.1.</p>

<p>It's important to emphasize what we consider "support" in this instance. After SMS 2.6.10, there will be no further releases of SMS, regardless of any issues that come up. We'll continue to operate the forums, but our focus is on support for Nova, so any questions in the SMS section won't have priority. Finally, we've decided that with the release of Nova 1.1 (date unknown), we will no longer offer the SMS section of the forums. We'll continue to offer SMS 2.6 as a download on the Anodyne site and we'll continue to provide the SMS extra content through AnodyneXtras even past the Nova 1.1 support deadline. Questions about this should be posted in the forums.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p><em>The Next Generation Is Coming...</em></p>

<p>The above tagline found its way onto the main Anodyne site around Thanksgiving as we officially announced that Nova 1.0 will be available in the spring of 2010. For the last 6 weeks, we've teased people with that and we're going to tease a little bit longer, but rest assured a release date has been set and will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The other day I was curious, so I did a quick search through the forums and found that the first mention of SMS 3 was over 3 years ago (December 28, 2006 to be exact). It's been a 3 year journey, but in November, we closed up shop on major development of Nova and we couldn't be happier with the product that came out of a harrowing 18 months of development. All of our efforts have gone toward building Nova and giving the community a taste of what's coming with Anodyne's second product. It's been a long road to get to this point, but we're incredibly proud of the product we've built and we think everyone who uses is going to agree that it's hands down the best way to manage an online RPG.</p>

<p>Even though major development is wrapped up, we're still plugging away at a bunch of things, first and foremost being bug fixing. The <a href="http://nova.anodyne-productions.com" target="_blank">Nova preview site</a> has a download where you can grab a copy of Nova and take it for a spin, and if you haven't, we encourage you to do so. If you find any issues, let us know and we'll be sure to get them patched up before Nova launches this spring.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, I've been working on writing up a bunch of blog posts about minor features that have found their way into Nova over the last year and half. Those will be starting on Tuesday January 5th. I've written up enough entries to get us to Nova launch, so be sure to come back to the blog every Tuesday for a new entry every week. These entries are a great way to see a list of those smaller items that are going to make Nova so much easier to use!</p>

<h2>AnodyneDocs</h2>

<p>At the tail end of the third quarter, Anodyne launched a new initiative to coincide with Nova: <a href="http://docs.anodyne-productions.com" target="_blank">AnodyneDocs</a>. This site is dedicated to providing a top-notch user guide for Nova. We've highlighted the documentation over the past few months, but we're now bringing it front and center along with the Anodyne wiki. The Nova documentation will continue to be updated on a monthly basis and we're looking in to the possibility of creating some very basic documentation for SMS that matches the style of Nova's user guide. At this point, updates to the wiki are few and far between and in the weeks leading up to Nova's launch, we'll likely pull the wiki down completely and just provide static information. More details will be available in the coming months.</p>

<h2>AnodyneXtras</h2>

<p>Much the same that we re-launched the documentation section of the Anodyne domain, we're going to do the same with our extra content pages. However, instead of it just being a couple pages off of the main site, this is going to be its own subdomain since we'll be hosting both SMS and Nova extra content. We're hard at work finalizing the site and we'll be launching it in the weeks leading up to the launch of Nova this spring, so make sure you keep an eye on the forums and the Anodyne site for more information!</p>

<p>We have some exciting ideas for AnodyneXtras that we'd like to see realized in the future including the ability to upload your own skins and ranks to the site, but bear with us as it's a slow process to put something that large in to place quickly. Our goal is to have the first pieces of such a system in place by the end of 2010.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>Over 2009, we've been more than impressed with the interest in Nova and the number of downloads of development builds has far surpassed anything we could have imagined. Because of the popularity of the development builds, we've decided that even after the release of Nova 1.0 we're going to continue doing development releases.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>SMS 2</strong> - 2,316</li>
	<li><strong>Nova development builds</strong> - 472</li>
</ul>

<h2>Q1 2010</h2>

<p>The coming quarter promises to be a whirlwind as we continue to make preparation for Nova's release this spring. On the surface, it'll likely seem like not much is going on, but given all the changes coming to the Anodyne site and getting skins built for Nova as well as a brand new AnodyneXtras site, we've got plenty to keep us busy.</p>

<p>Moving forward into the year, our focus is going to remain firmly planted in Nova. We haven't really had time to spend a lot of time thinking about what comes after 1.0, but we do have a few features in mind for Nova 1.1 and will probably start working on 1.1 a few weeks after the release of 1.0. As always, the blog and our Twitter feed (anodyneprod) is the best place to keep up with us!</p>
