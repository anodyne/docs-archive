<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q3 2010</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the third quarter of 2010 covering the period between <dfn>1 July</dfn> and <dfn>30 September</dfn>.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p>With six minor updates to Nova 1 out the doors, we turned our attention to a larger update and finally adding some new functionality to Nova. Version 1.1 of the system was released during Q3 and added one major new feature: multiple specification items. Now, sims can create multiple specification items and also attach tour items to a specific specification item. This great functionality should make it a lot easier for sims that have sub-sims or just want to expand beyond their original story to add some more variety. In the coming days, a second bug fix release will be out for Nova 1.1 to patch up some remaining issues.</p>

<h3>Nova 1.2</h3>

<p>Like we mentioned during the Q2 report, we’re not stopping with Nova 1.1. Originally, there were two releases planned for Nova 1. Now, there are at least 4, maybe 5. The change in our philosophy is simple: Nova 2’s development will take much longer than we originally anticipated, so there’s no sense leaving Nova 1 out there for 2 years without any updates. This way, we’re putting little bits of new functionality in to the system.</p>

<p>For Nova 1.2, we’re focusing on multiple manifests. It may in fact be one of the hardest features we’ve ever worked on, but we’re committed to providing a way to give sims more flexibility in how they display their manifests. Without getting in to the technical details, I will just say that the questions being posed by multiple manifests are tough. (Should manifest #2 be driven off of characters, positions or departments? These are the issues that vex us these days.)</p>

<p>The other feature landing in the second major update to Nova 1 is ban controls. Sometimes you just have a pesky player who constantly applies for your sim no matter how many times you reject him/her. Or you may have an issue with a spammer. No more! With ban controls, you can issue a level 1 ban to prevent someone’s application from going in to the database or reaching you (can be done by email address or IP address), or, you can issue a level 2 ban that will prevent someone from getting to the site at all (can only be done by IP address).</p>

<p>Both of these features, while relatively minor, should add a lot of value for current and future Nova sims.</p>

<h3>Nova 1.3</h3>

<p>Next on the list, slated for release in Q1 2011, is the third major update to Nova 1. Version 1.3 will focus entirely on our mini-wiki. Thresher Release 2 will add a few requested features and some other features that just make sense.</p>

<p>The first thing we’ll be doing is cleaning up the way categories are selected and managed for a wiki page. The fact is that a list of checkboxes just doesn’t cut it. The new way will be significantly cleaner and a “sexier” take on category management. As part of this update, users with enough permissions will also be able to add new categories on the fly instead of having to manage them from another page. Add to that new protections/restrictions on wiki pages and greatly expanding the flexibility of every system page and Release 2 of our mini-wiki will work even better for sims.</p>

<h2>Nova 1.4</h2>

<p>Still a ways out (Q2 2011 at the earliest), Nova 1.4 will add a few more smaller features to the system that will come in handy. The first, a feature that was in SMS but dropped from Nova, is a merit/demerit system (a.k.a. strikes) will be a great way for admins to track what users are doing. Have a point system to determine promotions? You can create a merit list to track that. Want to track when users are doing good things or bad things? You can create a merit list to track that. The flexible system should be a welcome addition to Nova.</p>

<p>Though far more minor, two additional features that will land in Nova 1.4 are award rejection reasons (currently you can’t specify a reason an award nomination was rejected) and post/log star ratings. Nothing too crazy, but iterative enhancements that will continue to make Nova the best solution for managing your RPG.</p>

<h4>Nova 2</h4>

<p>Work on Nova 2 is now in full swing. The first milestone is nearly complete, meaning the system can be installed fresh, upgraded from SMS, updated from Nova 1 and updated from Nova 2.x to 2.x+1. The focus of milestone 2 is the login system and the non-control panel pages. All in all, we suspect that milestone 2 will move fairly quickly as opposed to milestone 1. Some of the changes coming in Nova 2 are going to make managing your RPG so much easier and intuitive.

<h2>Q4 2010</h2>

<p>Like was the case during Q3, the fourth quarter of the year is dedicated to incremental Nova 1 updates and continued development of Nova 2. We expect to ship Nova 1.2 at some point during Q4 and begin limited development on Nova 1.3 before the close of the year. As always, the most up-to-date information can be found on the forums, our blog and our Twitter feed.</p>
