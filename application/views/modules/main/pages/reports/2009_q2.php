<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q2 2009</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the second quarter of 2009 covering the period between <dfn>1 April</dfn> and <dfn>30 June</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<h3>SMS 2.6</h3>

<p>Work has all but wrapped up on SMS during the first quarter. A few minor issues were resolved in the trunk and will be pushed out as SMS 2.6.9 when it's ready. We're going to try to push some updates into this release that will allow SMS sims to be notified of the release of Nova when the time comes. There's nothing terribly pressing in 2.6.9, but we'll do our best to get it out to people in a timely manner to patch up the last few bugs.</p>

<h3>SMS 2.x Support</h3>

<p>As SMS 2 winds down and we start moving toward Nova, questions are going to come up about how we're going to support SMS 2. Details haven't been worked out yet, but at this point, we're anticipating that we'll maintain SMS 2 support for between 3 and 6 months following the release of Nova. It's important to note that when we say "maintain support" it means that we'll continue to answer questions and help people on the forums with SMS 2 issues. There's a possibility that we'll maintain SMS 2 until the release of Nova 1.1, but again, it's far too early to tell for sure. We're making a concerted effort to put the update process at the forefront with Nova, so updating from SMS 2 to Nova should be a breeze.</p>

<p>The focus of Nova M6 is reporting, updating and SMS 2 upgrades, so once that milestone starts, we'll have a lot more information available as well as some development builds where people can start to test their sites and the upgrade process. Keep an eye on the blog and forums for more information about this coming this fall.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p>Nova is cruising now. We officially have 4 milestones behind us and the fifth is taking shape very quickly. We've gotten some good feedback so far from people who've tried out Nova, and we're more confident now than 3 months ago that we're moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>Just a reminder to anyone wanting to request a feature, Nova 1.0 is feature frozen now and any feature requests will be handled in subsequent Nova releases. We encourage people who are interested in what's going on with Nova to download a development build and install it on a live server or a local server and play around with it. There's no better way to see what's coming with Nova than to actually use it!</p>

<p>Finally, documentation has been a huge part of development and the documentation we're building for Nova is leaps and bounds above anything we've ever had before. The only way to know that it's working though is to hear from people about what they like and don't like. We want to make sure if there's any confusion in any parts of the documentation that you let us know so we can clear things up. We've started updating the documentation each month with the new development build, so make sure you're checking back frequently. You'll find the Nova documentation here.</p>

<h2>Q3 2009</h2>

<p>We're halfway through 2009 and things are shaping up really nicely. The upcoming quarter should see the completion of Nova M5 and a good start on M6 as well, setting us up for a very productive final quarter of 2009 and a promising start to 2010, the year of Nova! As always, keep an eye on the blog as we'll be updating about features and other things.</p>
