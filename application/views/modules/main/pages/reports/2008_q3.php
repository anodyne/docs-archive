<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q3 2008</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the third quarter of 2008 covering the period between <dfn>1 July</dfn> and <dfn>30 September</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<h3>SMS 2.6</h3>

<p>The third quarter finally saw the much anticipated release of SMS 2.6! It was a great milestone for Anodyne and an excellent way to wind down the SMS 2 line. In the last month, we've released two patches to the system with a third in the pipeline now for release in the next week or two. After that, there may be a fourth patch if it's needed, but at this point, we're not anticipating anything major to come up. If all goes accordingly to plan, SMS 2.6.3 will be the final SMS 2 release. None of us have had much time to reflect on the milestone, but it's bittersweet to be sure. Work started on the SMS 2 core in December of 2005, so we're quickly approaching 3 years we've been working on this code base. To be moving away from it is both exciting and sad. SMS 2 represented a huge step forward for Anodyne, but SMS 3 promises to be an equally large step forward.</p>

<p>Also in Q3, we released the first official Battlestar Galactica MOD for SMS 2. Based on data we received for SMS 3, we were able to build a fully functional MOD that users can download from the Extras section of our site. In the coming weeks, we're hoping to update the Enterprise MOD as well as releasing a Romulan and Cardassian MODs, again, all based on data we've received for SMS 3. At this point, we're going to attempt to keep up pace with SMS 3 in terms of genres, though the support won't be as robust as SMS 3 will be.</p>

<h3>SMS 2.x Support</h3>

<p>As SMS 2 winds down and we start moving toward SMS 3, questions are going to come up about how we're going to support SMS 2. Details haven't been worked out yet, but at this point, we're anticipating that we'll maintain SMS 2 support for between 3 and 6 months following the release of SMS 3. It's important to note that when we say "maintain support" it means that we'll continue to answer questions and help people on the forums with SMS 2 issues. There's a possibility that we'll maintain SMS 2 until the release of SMS 3.1, but again, it's far too early to tell for sure. We're making a concerted effort to put the update process at the forefront with SMS 3, so updating from SMS 2 to SMS 3 should be a breeze. More information will be available in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p>It's what a lot of people have been waiting for, and the wait is over. Anodyne is pleased to announce the official name for SMS 3: Nova. From this day forward, we're dropping all references to SMS 3 and will be calling it by it's new name. I'm sure it'll take people a little while to get acquainted to the new name, and you can certainly expect me correcting people on the forums, but we're excited about this new branding we've come up with. Huge thanks to Justin Chow and Jon Matterson for helping me hammer through a list of great names to come up with this one. In the end, we decided to go with Nova because of the representation of power and beauty. That's Nova's goal, to be both powerful and beautiful. If everything goes according to plan, you won't be disappointed!</p>

<p>In a move that Anodyne's never undertaken before, we're announcing today the launch of the Nova preview site at http://nova.anodyne-productions.com. The preview site will be your one-stop-shop for all things Nova. If you want to know about confirmed features, the preview site will have them. If you want to know about the development milestones and what we're working on, the preview will have it. We're going to be cramming all the information we have about Nova in to the preview site over the coming months, so make sure you check back there often.</p>

<p>Finally, we're excited to announce that a few days ago, we wrapped up the first development milestone. We all felt really good to get this one under our belts and it means that we're officially on our way. There are 7 remaining milestones to get through. Some will only take a couple weeks, others will take a couple of months. In the end though, Nova is a brand new product that we're excited to get in to people's hands when it's finally ready. The Anodyne staff has gotten a copy of Nova M1 for perusing, but don't worry, we're hoping to give you guys a sneak peak at the end of M2 so you can see what kinds of things to expect. Again, lots more information is going to be available on the preview site, the forums, and our blog, so keep an eye on those for the most updated info.</p>

<h2>Q4 2008</h2>

<p>So how are we going to end 2008? The major goal is M2. I'd love to have M2 out of the way and public preview of Nova available by year's end. Of course, things can happen, but at this stage in the game, that's the goal. We've already started to sit down and work out a new QA strategy for Nova which includes a fresh start with QA testers, so be sure to keep an eye on the forums for more information about that. Finally, we're looking to wrap up SMS 2.6.3 in the first weeks of the quarter and finally close the book on SMS 2. Much thanks to our awesome community for their support!</p>
