<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q1 2010</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the first quarter of 2010 covering the period between <dfn>1 January</dfn> and <dfn>31 March</dfn>.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p>For the first time, well, ever, something has supplanted SMS at the top of the quarterly report. Kind of weird to see something besides SMS all the way up here, but I guess it's that time, so here we go.</p>

<p>Nova makes its way to the top as we're now only a mere 9 days from launch. We were hard at work during the first quarter to patch up bugs in Nova and still continue to polish the system bit by bit. On 1 March 2010, we released the final public pre-release build of Nova before 1.0 and since then we've pushed out 3 private builds that fix a lot of bugs, add a new look and feel to the installation and overall system and even had the opportunity to add a few minor features to the system like mission groups and a new way of managing uploaded images in bios, missions and tour items. At this point, the goal is to freeze the source code in 5 or 6 days and let it sit without any changes for a couple days leading up to the release.</p>

<h3>Pre-Release Updates</h3>

<p>Since we've made pre-release builds of Nova available for over a year now, there are a bunch of people who are using pre-release versions on live sites (despite warnings about doing that). Nova 1.0 won't ship with the update files to go from a pre-release version to 1.0. Those update files will be available on AnodyneXtras starting the night of the 15th, but we will not offer any support for those types of updates. You should be doing either a fresh install of 1.0 or an upgrade from SMS 2.6.9 or higher to Nova 1.0. If you have questions about this, let us know in the forums or through the contact form.</p>

<h3>The Future of Nova</h3>

<p>Rest assured that Nova's future has been mulled over for weeks, even months, now and an announcement will come shortly after release as to where Nova is going. For the next 9 days though, our focus is entirely Nova 1.0 and getting this awesome product into everyone's hands.</p>

<h2>Nova Day 2010</h2>

<p>In 9 days, Anodyne's going to throw open the doors to Nova 1.0 and push the notification out to SMS sims around the Internet. But as with every release, there are a handful of people that try to get in right away. No doubt Nova is going to be the same way. So what is launch day going to look like? For starters, it's easily going to be the biggest day in Anodyne's storied history. Not only are we launching a new product, but we're rolling out several huge initiatives: AnodyneDocs and AnodyneXtras. (Technically, AnodyneDocs has been available for months, but the links are only available on the forums.)</p>

<p>Over the course of several hours leading up to 11:59PM, some of our sites will be backed up and new versions pushed up. We have a new integrated theme for our forums, a fantastic new theme for our blog, a whole new Anodyne Productions site, AnodyneXtras and some much needed updates to AnodyneDocs. Most of these pieces will be published and available beginning after 11PM on the 15th with the final piece, the Nova zip archives, being pushed up just before midnight. If you have questions about the launch day, let us know in the forums or our contact page.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>As alluded to above, there have been some changes to the Nova roadmap that'll be announced shortly after Nova 1.0's release. In fact, some of these changes are a massive departure from where we thought we'd be doing at this point. Because of these changes, we've had to consider support for SMS 2. Initially, there were some thoughts at extending SMS support, but in the end, Nova is our flagship product and it's time for people to make the transition from SMS to Nova. The upgrade process is painless and easy, so there's really no reason not to upgrade. Because of that, effective 15 October 2010, Anodyne will no longer provide support for SMS 2. That gives everyone 6 months to upgrade to Nova, so make sure you set aside some time to do that because we'd hate to see people out in the cold come this fall. As always, any questions or concerns about this should be directed to us on the forums or through the contact page on our site.</p>

<h2>AnodyneDocs</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, AnodyneDocs hasn't seen an update so far this year, but there's a good reason for that. We're doing our best to provide some amount of surprise over the new default look and feel of Nova 1.0, so we haven't been able to update the user guide since we're now using all kinds of new system screenshots that use the Pulsar skin. Rest assured though, lots of work has gone into the user guide including writing a handful of new tutorials that'll be available starting on the night of April 15th.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>Stat tracking for SMS changed significantly in March as we began collecting new download information and generating reports in a way that allows us to track downloads versus unique downloads. To that end, the numbers here are broken down between January/February and March.</p>
	
<ul>
	<li><strong>SMS (January/February)</strong> - 379</li>
	<li><strong>SMS (March)</strong> - 120</li>
	<li><strong>Nova development builds</strong> - 238</li>
</ul>

<h2>Q2 2010</h2>

<p>We're now only a mere 9 days away from the launch of Nova. This is a huge milestone for us, capping off nearly two and a half years of planning, development and testing work to bring our community the best possible product we can. Just judging from my use of the system so far, I think we've done that in a big way.</p>

<p>Like with any release, we'll be keeping a close eye on the forums to see what bugs are being reported and do our best to patch them quickly. Unfortunately, with a system as large as Nova, you can only test it so much before you have to release it and let people start using it and finding the remaining issues. Rest assured, a large number of bugs have already been squashed, so we're pretty confident this is a rock solid release.</p>

<p>Nova represents a massive shift for Anodyne. For five years, SMS has been at the forefront and dealing with its deficiencies has been commonplace for us and for you as well. Nova removes many of those roadblocks to make it even easier to manage your RPG, but we're not satisfied with that. In the coming days, we'll be talking more about where Nova is going and that work will begin in earnest in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>Finally, there will be a major announcement during the month of May, so be sure to keep an eye on the forums and our site for that information!</p>
