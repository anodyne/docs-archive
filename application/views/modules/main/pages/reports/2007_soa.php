<h1>State of Anodyne Productions &ndash; January 2007</h1>

<p>This document serves to provide the state of Anodyne Productions and its various projects as well as lay out goals for the coming calendar year.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>It's been a busy year for the SMS team. Since last January, we have released two major updates to the original launch of SMS (version 1.2) and have seen significant gains across the board in the number of people who are using SMS to power their sims. Our second release, SMS 1.5, did a lot for that, and in recent months, SMS 2 has provided a similar push. Generally, site administrators running SMS are pleased and happy to recommend our product to other game masters. We are well aware that SMS isn't for everyone, however. It's a similar situation with any piece of software. Sometimes it just do what some people want it to. That's fine, as long as our customers are pleased with what we've provided them.</p>

<h3>SMS 1.5</h3>

<p>SMS 1.5 addressed many of the things that plagued the original version and added significant functionality. Drawing from MODs from the community as well as some new work, SMS took a huge leap forward with the release of version 1.5. Released in March of 2006, SMS 1.5 was widely accepted and we managed to keep up with support requests, releasing 6 updates to SMS 1.5 in order to patch bugs. We have found that there are still quite a few sims still running this version. In August, we officially ended support for SMS 1.5 and in recent weeks have pulled all traces of the product from the website, prompting users to update to SMS 2.</p>

<h3>SMS 2</h3>

<p>In April of 2006, Jon Matterson turned over the SMS project and the version 2.0 push to me because of other commitments. Work proceeded through the summer until the release of SMS 2.0 in late-July of 2006. We were pleasantly surprised with the hype around SMS 2 and saw significant upgrades happening in the first few weeks. Since July, we have released four major updates to SMS 2 and another 8 patches to those releases to fix bugs that have been discovered (a ninth patch will be released in the coming week). It's safe to say that SMS is, right now, leaps and bounds above what we though it could be 8 months ago and is the premier online RPG manager.</p>

<p>SMS 2.5 is currently in development and brings some of the most radical changes to SMS that we've ever introduced (save for the jump from 1.5 to 2.0). Currently, SMS 2.5 is targeted for a late-February to early-March release. Following version 2.5, there's a packed roadmap of features for versions 2.6 and 2.7. The verdict is still out on whether or not we'll be issuing a 2.8 release. Currently, we're planning 2.6 for late-March and 2.7 for late-April. If all goes well, we'll begin development on SMS 3 immediately following the release of 2.7. Only a few details are currently available about SMS 3.0, but we'll be providing more information as we get closer to development.</p>

<h2>Fleet Management System</h2>

<p>There was a lot of hope that FMS would see its much-hyped return to the wild during 2006. The first projections put its release around late-summer 2006, but due to other commitments, Jon Matterson, the then Project Leader, had to relinquish the project to Mike Mendez, author of FMS 1.0. Mike's timeline moved the release to the Fall of 2006, but various factors moved the release back again, this time into the Winter of 2006. Eventually, due to time constraints, Mike Mendez left the FMS project. We are still optimistic that we'll be able to find a competent and knowledgeable project leader for the Fleet Management System to finally introduce a complete and working product to our eager and waiting supporters.</p>

<p>In the coming year, our number one goal is to get FMS staffed and out the door. The Anodyne loyal have been waiting for far too long for a stable fleet system that mirrors the mentality of SMS and we want to deliver that as soon as possible. As more information becomes available, we'll release it through our website and on the forums.</p>

<h2>Anodyne Product Testing Team</h2>

<p>In November, we added a small team of people who's only responsibility was testing our products to make sure they were the best they could possibly be. Led by Brian Smith, our Director of Quality Assurance and Product Testing, they managed to ensure that SMS 2.4 was our strongest release yet. We have high hopes that this team will continue to grow and perhaps eventually even take over support needs on the forums in time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It's been a big year for Anodyne. Besides products, we've also shaken up the leadership here. I was honored to be asked by Jon to step in to the role of Chief Executive Officer. On top of that, we've successfully moved servers and there's more great stuff coming in the next few months that we all think the community will really like. I'd like to take this time to thank our amazing community. You guys have all been very supportive through the transitions and you guys are the reason that we all keep doing what it is we do (which we haven't really figured out yet ourselves). Without you, we'd just be a bunch of lame guys working on this stuff for nothing, but instead, we're a bunch of lame guys working on this still for all of you.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to the coming year and everything that we'll accomplish together!</p>
