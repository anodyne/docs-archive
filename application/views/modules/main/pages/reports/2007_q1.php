<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q1 2007</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the first quarter of 2007 covering the period between <dfn>1 January</dfn> and <dfn>31 March</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>It's been a slow few months for SMS as we're working on the 2.5 release that includes somewhere in the ballpark of about 1200 code changes in all. We're quickly approaching Beta 1, which is an exciting milestone, but even after that test release, there's still a lot of work to be done. In the current iteration of SMS, the new user access system is almost all in place, we've managed to add quite a few small feature and updates, plus of course, bug fixes across the system. We've also fixed the issue where files would break because of being one line. The goal is to release SMS 2.5 beta 1 to the QA team by early- to mid-April, with the final release coming somewhere in the ballpark of mid- to late-May. This is obviously much later than we'd originally hoped, but in the end, we think it'll be well worth the wait.</p>

<h2>Fleet Management System</h2>

<p>Unfortunately there isn't a lot more to report with FMS. There is still no Project Leader available for the project, so it's indefinitely stalled. There's recently been a surging effort for people to get their hands on FMS 1. Anodyne has officially stopped supporting the product and will not distribute it for people to use. If you know someone who has a copy, you can get it from them, but public distribution of of FMS 1 without prior consent of Anodyne is prohibited. As more information becomes available on the project, we'll let the community know.</p>

<h2>AcademiA</h2>

<p>Jon Matterson finally undertook the newest Anodyne product during the quarter and has started working on things. He has a basic framework in place from which he's building the rest of the system. Since it's early in the project, there isn't a lot of additional information at this time, but as development progresses, he will be releasing additional information and we'll be updating the website to reflect the changes in development. After talking with Jon, we've internally set a target release date for AcademiA, but we are not ready at this time to release that information to the community. Stay tuned to the forums and Anodyne site for more information about this product.</p>

<h2>AnodyneBB</h2>

<p>Anodyne is pleased to announce that AnodyneBB is now an actual reality! We were lucky enough to find someone willing to tackle the AnodyneBB project. Charles Thompson has taken over the project and been hard at work developing a feature list and putting down a plan for how things will proceed. Charles brings to Anodyne a wealth of programming experience that we felt would be best served working on the more complicated bulletin board project. The project is still in the very early stages, so there's no word on how long the project will take. As more information becomes available, we'll release it on the website as well as the forums. We've also opened up a new section of the forums specifically for AnodyneBB. Please feel free to post your comments in there!</p>
