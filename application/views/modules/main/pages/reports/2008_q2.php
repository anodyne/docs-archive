<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q2 2008</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the second quarter of 2008 covering the period between <dfn>1 April</dfn> and <dfn>30 June</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<h3>SMS 2.6</h3>

<p>The second quarter saw the biggest chunk of development time done on the final major release of SMS 2 with several hundred commits being made to the SVN repository in the span of a few weeks. Once development wrapped up, the beta process began and we've been very happy with how that's been going. Most of the bugs that have been reported to date are relatively minor and nothing that would stop the release in its tracks. While there were a lot of additional things we wanted to do with 2.6, we realized that getting it out to the community in a timely manner was more important. We've set a release date of July 26th and will be finalizing the last pieces of the system in the coming weeks in anticipation of the launch.</p>

<p>At this point, we expect there will be a few minor point releases for 2.6, but it's our goal to have SMS 2.6 completely wrapped up no later than mid-September. Unlike previous point releases that would potentially add minor pieces of functionality, there are no plans to add any further functionality to SMS 2.6 after its release. Instead, we will focus our efforts entirely on bug fixes and any security issues (though we don't anticipate any) that may come up.</p>

<h3>SMS 2.x Support</h3>

<p>In the last quarter we made a difficult decision to drop all support for SMS versions prior to SMS 2.6 once that release is made available. The decision stems from some security enhancements that were made to 2.6 that would be too time consuming to go back to previous versions and fix. Versions of SMS prior to 2.4.1 suffer from a handful of security flaws that have been patched, and a good number of flaws were patched that exist in 2.5.6. Because of that, we'll end all support for all previous versions on July 26th. In addition, we will no longer be making previous versions available for download. We will be adding an option to the contact menu to request a previous version, but we are urging people not to take that avenue as it could leave them open to attacks in the future.</p>

<h3>SMS 3</h3>

<p>During the second quarter, we were even more vocal about the future of SMS and have begun making a lot more information available as to what people can expect in the future. A lot of time was spent outlining the various advantages we gain by using the CodeIgniter framework as well as highlighting some new features that people can expect in SMS 3 (internationalization,running multiple missions simultaneously, post/log/news commenting, etc.). As SMS 2.6 winds down development, even more information will be made available. Once we've officially wrapped up the 2.6 work, we'll begin the weekly development updates on the blog again.</p>

<p>As to the progress of SMS 3: work has in fact begun! We're still finalizing the feature list (unfortunately, we're no longer taking feature requests at this point, simply figuring out what's possible and how we're going to tackle things), but that should be done in the coming weeks. We've also spent a great deal of time working on the database schema that SMS 3 will use. We're already pretty excited about what the new schema and new framework are going to give us and in the early going of development, we've already seen some huge benefits. Which does bring me to the next point that there is a (kind of) working version of SMS 3. Obviously its incredibly early in the process, but things are starting to move along and in the coming months, you'll be seeing a lot more information about our plans for SMS's future.</p>

<h2>Q3 2008</h2>

<p>So what's on our plate for Q3? First and foremost is the release of SMS 2.6. On top of the actual application, there's going to be a lot of new documentation and updates to skins, plus a new skin or two on the horizon. We're doing our best to get everything ready for July 26th, but it's possible things may slip to a later date when it comes to the new skins and such. After that, our focus shifts almost entirely to SMS 3.</p>

<p>It's our goal to launch an SMS 3 preview site by the end of Q3 which will have all the confirmed details (and a few that we haven't unveiled yet) in a single place. We're going to be providing more information at the end of each development milestone about the things that were added and a breakdown of what the development work means to people who are going to eventually be using this product. While not in Q3, Anodyne will in the future be releasing another Application Skinning Interface for SMS 3 to help people get a (big) headstart on skinning. We haven't worked out the details yet, but it's going to be as close to the actual way SMS 3 handles things as we can get it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we'd encourage you to keep an eye on the development blog for the most up-to-date information about what's going on inside Anodyne.</p>
