<h1>State of Anodyne Productions &ndash; January 2008</h1>

<p>This document serves to provide the state of Anodyne Productions and its various projects as well as lay out goals for the coming calendar year.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<p>In terms of releases, it's been a relatively quiet year compared to 2006. In 2006, Anodyne released 19 updates to SMS ranging from version 1.5.0 to version 2.4.2. In 2007, we only released 10 updates to SMS and that number promises to be lower in 2008. As a whole, our development cycle has slowed over the last year and will stay around this pace for the remainder of the SMS 2 line, due to be completed by the end of 2008.</p>

<p>SMS 2.5 was a leap forward for the system that brought in a lot of requested features and fixes, but it doesn't stop there. The final two major releases of SMS2, 2.6 and 2.7 will be out by the end of 2008 and will close the book on SMS2. Version 2.6 of the system has been under development for a couple months now and is inching toward the beta phase sometime during the second quarter of this year. On the whole, 2.6 is a refinement release. It takes many of the features added to 2.5 and further refines them and brings more polish to the system as a whole. Focuses of the 2.6 line include a new Javascript library, dynamic acceptance and rejection messages, a personalized menu and many other smaller enhancements. Focuses of the 2.7 line haven't been finalized yet, but will likely be less sweeping than 2.5 or 2.6.</p>

<p>The next major step for SMS is the third installation, codenamed Jefferson. SMS3, unlike its two predecessors, will in fact not carry the name SMS for a variety of reasons. At this point, we're still mulling over the feature list and figuring out how we're going to accomplish things as we go. One thing we do know is that SMS3 will move to an open source framework built by Ellis Labs called CodeIgniter. The framework allows us a lot of flexibility with the system and even provides some shortcuts to features we've been eyeing for some time now (more PHP5 compatibility for example). As we move through the year, we'll be making more information about Jefferson available to the community through the support forums.</p>

<h2>Fleet Management System</h2>

<p>Nothing new to report.</p>

<h2>Janus</h2>

<p>We'd hoped to provide a big unveiling at this point with Janus, but when we discovered CodeIgniter, our first thought was that Janus would greatly benefit from using this. Because of that change, things are a little behind schedule with Janus, so we're not quite ready to pull the covers off just yet, but we're hoping by the second quarter to be able to make a big announcement about it. We're confident that you'll be surprised by what Janus is, but excited at the same time.</p>

<h2>Anodyne Product Testing Team</h2>

<p>With a small QA team in place for over a year, they've managed to get their feet wet with SMS 2.5 and get used to a QA process that we'll continue following for a while to come. I've been working with Brian closely over the last few weeks to establish an even better process that will help us test SMS and all our future products more thoroughly and (hopefully) quicker as well. We've extended a few invitations to some people to join the QA team and we'll likely be expanding again in time for SMS 2.7.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It's been a good year for Anodyne and we're plugging forward to finalize the SMS2 line this year as well as unveiling Janus in the next few months. As always, if you have questions, please feel free to use our message boards.</p>
