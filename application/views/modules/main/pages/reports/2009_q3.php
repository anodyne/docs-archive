<h1>Anodyne Productions Quarterly Report &ndash; Q3 2009</h1>

<p>This document serves as an update to the work going on with Anodyne Productions over the third quarter of 2009 covering the period between <dfn>1 July</dfn> and <dfn>30 September</dfn>.</p>

<h2>SIMM Management System</h2>

<h3>SMS 2.6</h3>

<p>Work on SMS all but wrapped up during the year's first quarter. We managed to release SMS 2.6.9 during the third quarter and are anticipating one, possibly two, additional minor releases between now and the release of Nova in 2010. Any bugs that people still find outstanding should be reported to Anodyne as soon as possible for consideration in SMS 2.6.10.</p>

<h3>SMS 2.x Support</h3>

<p>As SMS 2 winds down and we start moving toward Nova, questions are going to come up about how we're going to support SMS 2. Details haven't been worked out yet, but at this point, we're anticipating that we'll maintain limited SMS 2 support for between 3 and 6 months following the release of Nova. It's important to note that when we say "limited support" it means that we'll continue to answer questions and help people on the forums with SMS 2 issues, but there will be no future updates released. There's a possibility we'll continue to maintain SMS 2 until the release of Nova 1.1, but again, it's far too early to tell for sure. We're making a concerted effort to put the upgrade process at the forefront with Nova, so upgrading from SMS 2 to Nova should be a breeze.</p>

<h2>Nova</h2>

<p>Five down, two to go! With M5 out to the community, we're pleased to be on to some of the final pieces of Nova. The focus of M6 has been reporting, updating the Nova core and upgrading from SMS. To date, the only thing we've worked on is reporting which we've wrapped up in time for the monthly build. That means that the start of the quarter is focused entirely on updating Nova and working on the upgrade process. We'd set an internal target of November 1st for having M6 completed, but it's likely that date will slip a little bit because of the sheer volume of things needed for upgrading. As always, the forums and blog are the best place to keep abreast of what's going on with Nova development.</p>

<p>Just a reminder to anyone wanting to request a feature, Nova 1.0 is feature frozen now and any feature requests will be handled in subsequent Nova releases. We encourage people who are interested in what's going on with Nova to download a development build and install it on a live server or a local server and play around with it. There's no better way to see what's coming with Nova than to actually use it.</p>

<h2>AnodyneDocs</h2>

<p>At the tail end of the third quarter, Anodyne launched a new initiative to coincide with Nova: AnodyneDocs. This site is dedicated to providing a top-notch user guide for Nova. We've highlighted the documentation over the past few months, but we're now bringing it front and center along with the Anodyne wiki. The Nova documentation will continue to be updated on a monthly basis and we're looking in to the possibility of creating some very basic documentation for SMS that matches the style of Nova's user guide. At this point, updates to the wiki are few and far between and in the weeks leading up to Nova's launch, we'll likely pull the wiki down completely and just provide static information. More details will be available in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Stats (1 July 2009 - 30 September 2009)</h2>

<p>During the third quarter, SMS maintained some strong numbers and interest in Nova grew a little bit.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>SMS 2.6</strong> - 572</li>
	<li><strong>Nova development builds</strong> - 132</li>
</ul>

<h2>Q4 2009</h2>

<p>So what does the end of 2009 look like for Anodyne?</p>

<p>Nova continues to be our top priority. By the end of 2009, M6 will be complete and we'll have begun work on Thresher, Nova's integrated mini-wiki. Nova 1.0 will ship with Thresher Release 1 and by the end of the year, users will have their first look at what Anodyne is doing with this brand new feature. We'll continue to update AnodyneDocs with the latest Nova user guide updates which will includes lots of tutorials and tons of information. In addition, we've begun developing the new Anodyne Productions website as well as new themes for our blog and our forums. We're very excited about these visual changes and will give the community glimpses of these upcoming changes toward the end of the year. The next report from Anodyne will be our State of Anodyne Productions in January where we'll lay out some of our release plans for Nova as well as providing a time range in which we'll release Nova (a specific release date will come later in 2010).</p>

<p>As always, we want to thank our amazing community for their continued support as we develop Nova and work to give them, and others, the best possible RPG management solution that let's them get back to the game.</p>
