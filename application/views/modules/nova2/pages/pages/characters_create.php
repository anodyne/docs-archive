<p>Nova provides the ability to create a character independent of a player. This is handy for creating NPCs and playing characters to be linked to a player's record. By default, every player has the permissions to create a new character. NPCs are immediately put on the manifest but playing characters go into a pending queue that must be approved by an admin before they can be made available. After approving a playing character that was submitted by a player who is not an admin, the character will immediately be available for their use.</p>

<h4>Permissions</h4>

<p>In order to create a character, you must have <kbd>characters/create</kbd> privileges. In order to have unfettered access to create NPCs and playing characters, you must have level 2 access. All other players are given level 1 access by default.</p>

<h2>Creating a Character</h2>

<p>To create a character, simply fill out the form (it's the same form used for bios and the join form). In addition, you can select the type of character at the top of the page. By default, it's set to non-playing character. You can also select the position and rank for the character, though the admin has final say on the rank and position. When you're satisified with your character, click <strong>Submit</strong>. If you have level 2 permissions, the character will be immediately available, but if you have level 1 permissions, only NPCs will be immediately available on the manifest, all others must be approved by the admins.</p>
