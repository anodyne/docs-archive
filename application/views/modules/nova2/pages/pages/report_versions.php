<p>Nova provides access to a wealth of information about Nova itself for both informational purposes as well as debug purposes. This page will provide you with details about all previous versions of Nova as well as general system information and components used inside of Nova.</p>

<h2>Version History</h2>

<p>During the release stages of Nova 1.0.x, the version history tab will be populated with a short list of any updates that may have been released for Nova 1.0. Once another minor version is release (1.1 for example), the simple list will be replaced with an accordion widget that will list the versions and their updates along with all the changes made. This should be used for reference after updating to see what's been changed.</p>

<h2>System Information</h2>

<p>The system information tab contains the most basic of information about Nova. You will see the site URL, the version number as stated by the files, the version number as stated by the database and CodeIgniter's version. This information can be critical in determining if there are issues with Nova related to conflicting versions or if your site's URL is causing problems.</p>

<h2>System Components</h2>

<p>Nova is a massive system and is made up mostly of code developed by Anodyne. However, we have elected to use plugins and other libraries from time to time because of the established nature of the work. In some cases, we couldn't dream of duplicating the work, so we've decided to use other resources. The system components tab lists all those plugins, libraries and other tools being used by Nova. Clicking on the link will take you to that component's website.</p>

<p class="critical"><strong>Warning:</strong> Never attempt to upgrade a system component on your own. Anodyne keeps track of updates to these components and will test updates inside of Nova to ensure nothing breaks in the process. Upgrading components on your own may lead to Anodyne voiding support until you are using verified components again.</p>
