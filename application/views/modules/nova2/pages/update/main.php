<p>It isn't enough to just release a system like Nova, you have to maintain it and you have to make it better. Anodyne intends to exactly that with Nova in the same way we've done it with SMS for years now. Because of that, on a regular basis you can expect to be notified of updates to Nova. Some of these may be minor and only address bugs while others will be larger and introduce new functionality to the system.</p>

<p>Please read the update notes that correspond to the version you are updating from.</p>

<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> These update notes only apply to the physical Nova files and not the database update portion. You can update the database from any version of Nova to a higher version.</p>
