<p>Nova provides a deck listing feature that is more robust than what SMS offered, and as such, the data from SMS is not upgraded to the Nova format. As a substitute however, we're providing an archive view of the data from SMS' deck listing table as a quick means of copying the content from one page and pasting it into the Nova deck listing.</p>

<p>From the archive index, simply click on the deck listing link and you'll be shown the full deck listing out the SMS table. You can't take any action on these items as the archive is <dfn>read-only</dfn>.</p>
