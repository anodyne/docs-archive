<p>Nova includes a simple docking request form for RPGs that may allow docking or joining with their sim. Like the bio/join, tour and specs forms, the docking request form is built entirely out of the database meaning that an admin can easily change the fields and sections of the form.</p>

<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> Nova does not support joint mission abilities. All joint missions will need to be run by other means.</p>

<p>Once someone has filled out the form and clicked submit, a new record will be added to the database and, if email is enabled, notifications will be sent out to the user and the game masters. It is the responsibility of the game master to review any pending applications and take action on them.</p>

<p class="important">This page is disabled by default in Nova. Setting up your RPG as a base will automatically enable the menu item.</p>
