<h1><?php echo $header;?></h1>

<p>In any RPG, there are levels of seniority. Often, those levels are displayed through the use of ranks. Most of the genres Nova ships with involve ranks as a fundamental way of showing a character&rsquo;s status in the chain of command (though that doesn&rsquo;t always reflect seniority in the RPG&rsquo;s management group). Nova uses a series of rank images (unique for each genre) to highlight ranks of characters. From the Rank Management page, admins can updated all the ranks available throughout the system.</p>

<p>Rank Management displays two informational boxes at the top of the page. The first is a listing of the different rank sets available, represented by the rank set&rsquo;s preview image. Every rank set in Nova must have a preview image; if it doesn&rsquo;t have a preview image, the ranks will not display through the management system. Below the listing of rank sets is a listing of rank classes. For rank sets that don&rsquo;t use a lot of classes, these won&rsquo;t mean a lot. However, some ranks sets have multiple classes. Clicking on the images will switch the classes to allow admins to change different portions of the set.</p>

<h4>Permissions</h4>

<p>In order to manage ranks, you need to have <kbd>manage/ranks</kbd> permissions.</p>

<h2>Adding a Rank</h2>

<p>To add a rank to Nova, simply click on the <strong>Add Rank</strong> link near the top of the page. A pop-up window will appear with all the fields needed for creating a new rank. Once you have filled out all the fields, click submit and Nova will create the rank for you. Once the rank has been created, you can assign the rank to characters.</p>

<h2>Editing a Rank</h2>

<p>By default, Nova will only show you the most important rank fields: name and image. Since those are the two fields you&rsquo;re bound to be updating most frequently, we wanted to highlight them. If you want to edit other pieces of the rank record, click on the More button to the right and you will be able to see the rest of the entry. To update a rank in Nova, all you need to do are change the fields you want on the Rank Management page and click Update at the bottom. You can change as many ranks as you want at the same time and Nova will update all of them simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Deleting a Rank</h2>

<p>Deleting a rank in Nova is as easy as clicking the delete checkbox on all the ranks you want to delete and clicking Update at the bottom of the page. After Nova finishes updating the ranks, it will go through and delete the marked ranks as well.</p>

<p class="critical"><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting ranks is permanent and cannot be undone!</p>
