<p>Thresher uses categories to organize pages so they're easy to find after the fact and so admins can keep information grouped together in a way that makes sense and is easy for users to get to and find. The category listing page shows a complete list of all the categories in the system. The first category will always be the <strong>Uncategorized</strong> item which holds all pages that don't have a category assigned to them. Clicking on a one of the category links will redirect the user to a page that lists all pages within the given category.</p>

<p>If a user is logged in and has <kbd>wiki/categories</kbd> permissions, an edit categories link will be at the top of the page.</p>
