<p>The Docked Items page is a way for players to see the current and previous docked items and is organized into two distinct tabs for each state. If the lists are populated with items, they'll display the item name and URL, the game master and the <a href="#" class='tip' tooltip='<?php echo img($images['view']);?>'>view icon</a>. Clicking on the view icon will open the docked item so that all the details can be viewed. The only item that isn't viewable is the game master's email address.</p>

<p class="important">This page is disabled by default in Nova. Setting up your RPG as a base will automatically enable the menu item.</p>
