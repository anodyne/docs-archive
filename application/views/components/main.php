<p>Starting with Nova 1.0, Anodyne has been committed to providing the best possible documentation for our products. We've gone to great lengths to make that goal happen by making exhaustive information for Nova available to our users. While the SMS documentation program never got off the ground, we do provide a limited user guide with answers to commonly asked question and some limited tutorials on using the system. If you have questions about the documentation, would like to report typos or incorrect information or get involved with writing documentation, please <a href="http://www.anodyne-productions.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>
