<h1>Nova 3 Requirements</h1>

<p>We've worked hard to make sure Nova's requirements are as wide open as possible so more people can use it, but there are still a few requirements that you should verify before you try to install Nova 3. In the event the server you're going to be installing Nova on doesn't support some or all of these things, you should contact your hosting provider and ask them about the possibility of upgrading these items.</p>

<h2>PHP</h2>

<p>You will need a server that is running PHP, a dynamic web development language that Nova is built in. Nova 3 requires that your server has at least <nobr><dfn>PHP 5.3.0</dfn></nobr> installed. If you have less than 5.3 installed, the installation will fail and you won't be allowed to continue. Much of Nova 3 leverages functions and methods built in to PHP 5.3 and not available in previous versions.</p>

<h2>MySQL</h2>

<p>You will need a server (and account) that has MySQL available. Nova is a database-driven system which means it needs a database (MySQL) to run. As long as you have <dfn>MySQL 4.1</dfn> or higher, you should be fine.</p>

<h2>A Browser</h2>

<p>Since Nova is web-based software, you'll need a browser in order to use it. These days, there are a lot of browsers out there and most of them should work, but some of the older generation browser aren't supported because of their lack of support for technologies and tools used in Nova. Our recommendation is to use <dfn>Firefox</dfn> (version 4 or higher) or a newer build of <dfn>Google Chrome</dfn> (version 12 or higher). In addition, we also support Safari 5 and higher as well as Internet Explorer 8 and higher. Make sure you have JavaScript turned on as many of Nova's features require it.</p>
