<p>Beginning with Nova, Anodyne has been committed to providing the best possible documentation for our products. We've gone to great lengths to make that goal happen with an exhaustive user guide for Nova. While the SMS documentation program never got off the ground, we do provide a limited user guide with answers to commonly asked question and some tutorials on using the system. If you have questions about the documentation or would like to report typos or incorrect information, please contact <a href="http://www.anodyne-productions.com" target="_blank">Anodyne</a>.</p>
