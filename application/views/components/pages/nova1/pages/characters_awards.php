<p>Sometimes a character does something in the game that deserves recognition and sometimes a player does something out of the game that deserves some praise. We've built awards into Nova for just those reasons.</p>

<p>When you get to the Give/Remove Award page you'll be presented with a list of all active, inactive and non-playing characters. After clicking on one of the character names, you'll be taken to a page where you can give them an award or remove one of their existing awards.</p>

<h2>Giving an Award</h2>

<p>To give a character an award, simply select the award from the dropdown menu. After selecting the award, Nova will display the description for the award to make sure you have the right one. If you're satisfied it's the award you want to give, put your reason in and click <strong>Submit</strong> and the award will immediately be added to the database and will be seen on their character bio.</p>

<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> Nova determines which awards should be shown in the dropdown menu based on the type of character it is. Non-playing characters are only allowed to receive in character awards. Playing characters can receive all awards.</p>

<h2>Removing an Award</h2>

<p>If you make a mistake and need to remove an award from a character, you can do so from the All Received Awards tab. Nova will display all the received in character awards. If the character is associated with a player who has any out of character awards, the out of character awards will be displayed in a separate section at the top. To remove an award from a character, simply click on the remove icon and Nova will remove the award.</p>
