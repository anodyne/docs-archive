<p>Not all RPGs will use a specs page, but for the large majority that do, Nova's specs page gives game masters the ultimate flexibility to make it exactly what they want it to be.</p>

<p>Like Nova's join/bio form, the specs page is generated entirely from the database, giving game masters the flexibility to add and remove fields they need or don't need. Further, sections can be managed as well. There isn't anything on the specs page that can't be edited to the liking of the game master. All edits to the form happen through the Specs Field Management page while all edits to the specs data happen through the Specs Management page.</p>
