<p>Nova provides an easy way to track players' activity in conjunction with the posting requirement you've laid out in Site Settings. This is a great way to see which players are active and which aren't, plus how long they've been inactive.</p>

<p>The crew activity report displays a list of names on the left. These names are the primary character for each active player and include an indicator if the player is on LOA or ELOA so it's easy to judge if there's a reason for their inactivity. Just below their name are links to both the player and character biography pages for quick reference as well as how long it's been since their last login and last post.</p>

<p>If a player's last post hasn't come inside of the posting requirement, the text is highlighted red. Similarly, if a player's last login hasn't come inside of the posting requirement, the text is highlighted red. While the login doesn't necessarily correlate with the posting, it provides a good indicator if they haven't logged in to the system in a few weeks, but have had a post inside of the posting requirement date. </p>

<p>The additional columns to the left will show post counts for two time periods. The first is the posting requirement timeframe that you set in Site Settings. Nova will count each player's posts for that number of days. The second is a 30-day timeframe to give you an idea of how the player has done with their posting levels over the last month.</p>

<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> The 30-day timeframe is just that, 30 days prior and does not correlate to the start of the current month.</strong>
