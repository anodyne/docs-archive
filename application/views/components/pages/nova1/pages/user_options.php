<p>Nova gives players control over the look and feel of the system once they're logged in through the Site Options page. From this page you can change your personalized links, update the rank set you see around the site and change your skin options for the main, admin and wiki sections.</p>

<h4>Permissions</h4>

<p>In order to update your site options, you need to have <kbd>user/account</kbd> permissions with either access level 1 or 2. Site options cannot be updated for other players, only the player themselves can make those changes.</p>

<h2>Updating Your Personalized Links</h2>

<p>In Nova's dashboard, there is a panel for five personalized links. These links allow players to access frequently used pages quickly. In the My Links tab, there are five dropdown menus with all the available options. You can only select menu items which you have access to. Once you have selected your links, clicking <strong>Update</strong> will lock your changes in, update the database then update your session. In order for your new links to be seen in the dashboard, you will have to either navigate to another page or refresh the current page.</p>

<h2>Updating Your Skins</h2>

<p>Nova's change to skin the main, admin and wiki sections separately means that players can choose which skin they want to use for each section based on what the admins have made available in the skin catalogue. Most users will have access to all active items, but any players who have <kbd>site/catalogueskins</kbd> access will also see all in development items as well. This ensures that admins can test out skins to make sure they work properly on a live site without impacting the rest of the players.</p>

<p>To save on space, Nova doesn't display all the preview images for the skins. After selecting a skin from one of the dropdowns, Nova will display the preview image. Once you're satisfied with your choice, click <strong>Update</strong> and Nova will update your preferences and change your session setting. In order for your new skins to be seen, you will have to either navigate to another page or refresh the current page.</p>

<h2>Updating Your Ranks</h2>

<p>Nova allows players to choose the rank set they see throughout the site when they're logged in. Players can choose which rank set they want to use based on what the admins have made available in the rank catalogue. Most users will have access to all active items, but any players who have <kbd>site/catalogueranks</kbd> access will also see all in development items as well. This ensures that admins can test out ranks to make sure they work properly on a live site without impacting the rest of the players. After selecting your rank option, click <strong>Update</strong> and Nova will update your preferences and change your session setting. In order for your new ranks to be seen, you will have to either navigate to another page or refresh the current page.</p>
