<p>While we've gone to great lengths to make the upgrade process as seamless and accurate as possible, there's no way for it to 100% accurate for 100% of the sims using it. Because of that, we've created an item in the archive section for viewing active, inactive and NPCs. This will help admins check the Nova version of the manifest against what the SMS version was. The listing will show the character's rank, name, position and department similar to the manifest.</p>

<p>From the archive index, simply click on the characters link and you'll be shown the listing of all active characters out the SMS table. At the top are links for inactive characters and NPCs as well.</p>

<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> Unless you've made no changes whatsoever to the SMS positions, departments or ranks, you will need to manually make changes to your characters.</p>
