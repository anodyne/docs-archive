<p>Nova provides the ability for game masters to control who can post what. This is especially handy in the case of a player who consistently breaks rules or as a way to ensure new players are posting in the proper format or not breaking any RPG rules. Setting a player's moderation status is done through their account page under the admin tab.</p>

<p>The moderation status report is simply a way to let game masters know the status of every player in the system with a quick glance. Users who are able to post freely in a category will be shown with a green icon in their row under the column of that post type. Users who are not allowed to freely post in a category will be sown with a red icon instead.</p>
