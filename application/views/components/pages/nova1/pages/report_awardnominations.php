<p>Nova provides the ability for players to nominate other players for awards to recognize their accomplishments both in character as well as out of character. However, sometimes, a nomination isn't appropriate for a situation or is put in the system wrong and needs to be rejected. Other times, it'll be accepted. The award nominations report shows a complete list of all award nominations put through the system as well as its final status.</p>

<p>The award nomination report includes a list of characters, the award they were nominated for, who nominated them, the date they were nominated, the reason given for nominating them and an icon to show whether the award was <a href="#" class='tip' tooltip='<?php echo img($images['green']);?>'>accepted</a>, <a href="#" class='tip' tooltip='<?php echo img($images['red']);?>'>rejected</a> or is still <a href="#" class='tip' tooltip='<?php echo img($images['yellow']);?>'>pending</a>.</p>
