<h1><?php echo $header;?></h1>

<p>Posting is at the heart of an RPG and Nova makes it easy to organize your posts into missions (the term missions can be changed from the language files if you prefer something else). RPGs can choose to run multiple missions at the same time or even just one at a time. Managing them is the same no matter what and is as simple as managing other tasks in Nova.</p>

<p>One of Nova's new features is the system setting start and end times for you based on what you set the status to. If you create a new mission with a status of current, Nova will automatically set the start date to the time when you click Update. If you update a mission with a status of current to a new status of completed, Nova automatically sets the end date to that time. This means that when you change statuses of a mission, you don't need to worry about anything but changing the status and Nova does the rest for you!</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>In order to manage missions, you need to have <kbd>manage/missions</kbd> permissions.</p>

<h2>Adding a Mission</h2>

<p>To add a mission to Nova, simply click on the <strong>Add Mission</strong> link near the top of the page. You will be redirected to a page with two tabs: info and images. In the info tab, fill out all of the fields. When you've completed the fields in the info tab, click on the image tab and select your images from a list of uploaded images (if you have any) or use the text field to manually put the name of the image in the field. Once you're done, click <strong>Submit</strong> and Nova will create the mission.</p>

<h2>Editing a Mission</h2>

<p>To edit a mission in Nova, simply click on the edit icon to the right of the mission information. You will be redirected to a page with two tabs: info and images. In the info tab, update all of the fields you want. When you've finished updating the fields in the info tab, click on the images tab and select your image from a list of uploaded images (if you have any) or use the text field to manually put the name of the image in the field. Once you're done, click <strong>Submit</strong> and Nova will update the mission.</p>

<h2>Deleting a Mission</h2>

<p>To delete a mission from Nova, simply click on the delete icon to the right of the mission information. A modal window will appear and ask you to confirm you want to delete the mission. If you do, click <strong>Submit</strong> and Nova will delete the mission. If you don't want to delete the mission, you can click anywhere outside of the modal window, click the X or hit the Escape key to abort the delete process.</p>

<p class="critical"><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting missions is permanent and cannot be undone! It will affect any mission posts included in that mission.</p>
