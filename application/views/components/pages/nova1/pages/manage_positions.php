<h1><?php echo $header;?></h1>

<p>Positions are a central component to Nova and are likely to be one of those things you update on a more frequent basis than departments or ranks. Because of that, we've tried to highligh the things you' likely to be changing most often: the name and number of open slots. Everything else is hidden by default with a simple More button that will show the rest of the entry. The top of the Position Management page has a simple box with all the departments. Clicking on a department will show that department's positions for you to update. Like other features in Nova, it's possible to create your own positions, edit existing positions and delete positions.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>In order to manage positions, you need to have <kbd>manage/positions</kbd> permissions.</p>

<h2>Adding a Position</h2>

<p>To add a position to Nova, simply click on the <strong>Add Position</strong> link near the top of the page. A pop-up window will appear with all the fields needed for creating a new position. Once you have filled out all the fields, click submit and Nova will create the position for you. Once the position has been created, you can assign characters to the position.</p>

<h2>Editing a Position</h2>

<p>One of the new features in Nova is the use of a simple slider to update the number of open slots. The slider ranges from 0 to 50. Simply set the number of open slots you want and move on to the next position. To update a position in Nova, all you need to do are change the fields you want on the Position Management page and click Update at the bottom. You can change as many positions as you want at the same time and Nova will update all of them simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Deleting a Position</h2>

<p>Deleting a position in Nova is as easy as clicking the delete checkbox on all the positions you want to delete and clicking Update at the bottom of the page. After Nova finishes updating the positions, it will go through and delete the marked positions.</p>

<p class="critical"><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting positions is permanent and cannot be undone!</p>
