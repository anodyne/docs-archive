<p>Nova has a simple award system built-in that allows game masters to give awards to players. The awards can be in character awards, out of character awards, or awards that are a hybrid of both IC and OOC. Nova provides the ability to view a complete list of awards or to look at the details of a single award.</p>

<h2>All Awards</h2>

<p>By default, when you visit the Crew Awards page, Nova will display a list of all awards that have their display flag set to yes. The awards are ordered according to their order ID which can be changed on the Awards Management page.</p>

<p>Nova uses both large and small images. The small images are Character Awards page while the large images are used on the main awards page. If a large image does not exist, it will use the smaller image. If a smaller image does not exist, it will display the name of the award. Further to the right is the name of the award followed by the description of the award. Clicking on the details link to the far right will open up that award's detail page.</p>

<h2>Award Details</h2>

<p>A new feature of Nova is award detail pages. At the top of the page is the large image of the award (if the large doesn't exist, it'll use the small image) followed by the description of the award. Following the description is the category that the award has been put into as well as how many times the award has been given. At the bottom of the page is a table listing all the recipients of that award, when they received it and the reason given for giving the award to the character/player.</p>
