<p>The credits page lists two types of credits: permanent credits and your own credits. The user-entered credits can be changed from the Site Messages page and can include anything you want. The permanent credits cannot be edited (and shouldn&rsquo;t be edited either!).</p>

<p>In the permanent credits, Anodyne gives credit where credit is due, linking to the CodeIgniter homepage among other things. In addition to those credits, Nova will automatically pull the rank and skin credits from the database and put them in for the skin and rank set currently being displayed. This ensures that no matter who is looking at the credits page, it is an accurate reflection of the credits needed for the rank set and skin being used.</p>
