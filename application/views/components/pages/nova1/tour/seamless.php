		Developers, meet a whole new world of easy!<br /><br />
		
		Anodyne has always cautioned admins against making changes to core files. But let's face it, when you want to modify something in SMS, you don't have a choice. Nova gives you a choice.<br /><br />
		
		Built with extreme extensibility and ease-of-use for developers in mind, Nova introduces a feature known as Seamless Substitution to the mix that lets developers replace core view files, Javascript files and images with their own files on a skin level or even for the whole system, all without touching a single core file. When an update comes out, you update like normal and your changes stay intact.
