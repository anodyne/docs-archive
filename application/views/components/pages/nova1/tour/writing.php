		SMS brought integrated posting to a whole new level that made it easy for users to work on posts and joint posts with other users, but Nova takes the idea of integrated posting to a whole new level with a wide array of new features.<br /><br />
		
		Gone are the days of limiting the number of people who can participate in a joint post. Now, everyone on the RPG can participate with a simple select and click interface.<br /><br />
		
		Spice it up a little bit by posting as other characters that are tied to your account. You can post mission posts and personal logs as any of the character associated with your account to give that little added perspective to the story.
