<h1>Nova Tour: Dynamic Forms</h1>

<div class="tour">

		Let's face it, no two RPGs are alike, so why should the forms they use be the same for all of them? We think they shouldn't, so we've created an easy-to-use system that lets you customize the bio/join, docking request, specs and tour forms to exactly how you want them!<br /><br />
		
		Driven completely out of the database, the new dynamic forms give admins the ultimate control all from a handful of pages in the Control Panel.
