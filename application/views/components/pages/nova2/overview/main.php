<p>To make the user guide easier, we've simplified its organization. Everything is now broken down in to one of three sections: Getting Started, The Kitchen Sink and Developers. If you're looking for how to get up and running Nova 2 (including installation, upgrading from SMS, updating Nova and more), check out the Getting Started section. Pretty much everything else can be found in The Kitchen Sink section. Finally, developers will benefit from a wide array of tutorials, resources and documention in the Developers section, including all of our resources on skinning and modifications.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> If you're looking for the Nova 2 page guides, we regret to inform you that they've been removed from the Nova 2 user guide. Not only are they tedious to write, but they're difficult to keep accurate as Nova changes through updates. The Nova 1 page guides still exist, but we will not be doing page guides for any future Nova releases.</p><br>
