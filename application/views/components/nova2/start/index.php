<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Thank you for choosing Nova to manage your game! Though it may not seem like a big decision, we think it is and we want to make sure Nova is as easy to use as possible so you can stop worrying about managing your game and get back to playing it.</p>

<p>Part of being easy to use is making sure you can get up and running with Nova with as little effort and time as possible. We've gone to great lengths in Nova 2 to make sure your first experience with the software is as painless as possible. To make it even easier, we've written some detailed guides on how to get started with Nova.</p>
