		<p>Storytelling isn't just a pastime of the English language, so why severely limit international RPGs from using Nova? To make sure that everyone in the world can take advantage of Nova's powerful and easy-to-use features, we've internationalized Nova's text so it can be easily translated into any language you want! All you have to do is change a few files and you're off to the races.</p>
