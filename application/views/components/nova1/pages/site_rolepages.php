<h1><?php echo $header;?></h1>

<p>Nova uses a simple role based access control (RBAC) system. Users are assigned a role and the role dictates what they can and can't access. Those roles are made up of pages and access levels. Because of this system, you are able to create your own pages and tie them in to Nova's access control system. From the Role Pages management page, you can add, edit and delete role pages.</p>

<p>The Role Pages page is accessible from the Roles management page as a link.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>In order to manage access role pages, a user needs to have <kbd>site/roles</kbd> permissions.</p>

<h2>Adding an Access Page</h2>

<p>To create a new access page, simply click on the Add New Role Page link. A modal box will pop-up on the screen with all the fields you need to fill-in. After supplying the name of the page, its URL, the access level (if you don't need multiple level, just set this to zero) and the group it's associated with, just click Submit and your role page will be created. Once created, you'll be able to add your new page to any of your roles.</p>

<h2>Editing an Access Page</h2>

<p>To edit an access page, simply click on the edit icon to the right of the list of role pages. A modal window will pop-up with all the fields you can edit. After updating the fields you want, just click Submit and your role page will be updated.</p>

<h2>Deleting an Access Page</h2>

<p>To delete an access page, click on the delete icon to the right of the list of role pages. A modal window will pop-up confirming that you want to delete that role page. If you want to delete the role page, simply click Submit. If you do not want to delete that access role, you can hit Escape, click anywhere outside of the modal window or click the X icon in the upper lefthand corner of the modal window.</p>
