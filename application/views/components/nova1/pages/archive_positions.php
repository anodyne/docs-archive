<p>While we've gone to great lengths to make the upgrade process as seamless and accurate as possible, there's no way for it to 100% accurate for 100% of the sims using it. Because of that, we've created an item in the archive section for viewing positions from the SMS tables. This will help admins manually transfer their positions from the SMS table to Nova.</p>

<p>From the archive index, simply click on the positions link and you'll be shown the listing of all positions out the SMS table. At the top are links for the departments to navigate through the various positions available. In addition to name and description, the listing also shows the number of open slots for each position.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note:</strong> Unless you've made no changes whatsoever to the SMS positions, you will need to manually make changes to your positions.</p>
