<h1><?php echo $header;?></h1>

<p>In character posts are one for other players to get to know your character, but personal logs are another great way to delve deeper in to your characters. Personal logs allow your character to share details they may not share with other characters. These are great tools for character development.</p>

<p>The page is split up in to 3 tabs: activated, saved and pending. The tabs allow you to easily move from one status of mission post to the other quickly. The saved tab will show you all in progress mission posts. If you get an email stating you have pending mission posts to approve, you will come to the pending tab to approve them.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>In order to manage mission posts, you need to have <kbd>manage/posts</kbd> permissions with either access level 1 or 2. Level 1 allows an author to see their own mission posts, activated and saved. Level 2 allows an admin to see all mission posts in all states.</p>

<h2>Editing a Mission Post</h2>

<p>Like most other components in Nova, you can easily edit a mission post by clicking on the edit icon and making your changes in the pop-up window that appears. Clicking <strong>Submit</strong> will complete the update and the changes will be seen immediately for that post.</p>

<h2>Deleting a Mission Post</h2>

<p>Deleting a mission post is only a matter of clicking on the delete icon and confirming you want to delete the post by clicking <strong>Submit</strong>. If you decide that you don't want to delete the post, you can get out of the modal window by either clicking the X in the upper corner, hitting escape on your keyboard or clicking anywhere outside the window.</p>

<h2>Approving a Mission Post</h2>

<p>If an admin has set a moderation flag on a player's ability to post mission posts, their posts will automatically be held for review. If that happens, Nova will send an email out to anyone with <kbd>manage/posts</kbd> permissions to notify them of a pending post. In addition, a notification will appear in the admin control panel as well. (If you want to view the mission post, you can click the view icon and you'll be taken to that mission post.) You can choose to approve the mission post by clicking on the approve icon and confirming you want to approve that post by clicking <strong>Submit</strong>. If you do not want to approve the post, simply delete it.</p>
