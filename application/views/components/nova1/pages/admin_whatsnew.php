<h1><?php echo $header;?></h1>

<p>Quite simply, the what's new page will display the launch release notes for the current version to give users an idea of what's new in the current version of Nova. Launch release notes are just a few sentences about what's changed and not a complete blow-by-blow list of every change made. The full changelog is still available through the <?php echo Html::anchor('nova1/reports/versions', 'System &amp; Versions report');?>.</p>

<p>In addition to displaying as a link on the menu, after updating the system, every user will be shown the what's new page as a modal window the first time they log in after the update. The modal window will only appear once for each update.</p>
