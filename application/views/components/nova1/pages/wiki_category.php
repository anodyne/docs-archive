<p>The category page listing shows all pages found in the given category. The category being displayed will be shown in the page title along with links to all pages found in that category.</p>

<p>Because of the potential for these category pages to get long, we've included a quick search feature that allows you to quickly and easily filter results based on what you type. To use the quick search, simply begin typing in the search box above the pages and Thresher will filter the results that you want.</p>
