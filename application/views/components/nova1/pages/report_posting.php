<h1><?php echo $header;?></h1>

<p>The Posting Levels report gives an overview of the posting levels of every player in the system as well as every character. In addition to the player/character's name and date of their last post, all their mission posts, personal logs and news item counts are shown as well as a complete total. In the event a player hasn't posted in the required timeframe (set in Site Settings), the text in the row will be displayed in red.</p>

<h2>Search Players/Characters</h2>

<p>The Posting Levels report has the ability to filter the table of names if you're looking for a single player or character. To filter the table down, simply use the text field at the top of the each tab pane to narrow the results down. If more than one result matches what was typed, Nova will display all those records.</p>
