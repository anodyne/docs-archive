<p>Mission posts are the heart and soul of Nova's posting features. Mission posts are where you play the game (assuming you're using Nova's built-in posting features). You can run multiple missions at the same time, so there will always be something for everyone to post about.</p>

<p>Mission posts consist of authors, a title, a timeline, a location, a mission, content, and any tags you want to put on your post for it to be easily found in a search later on. You can post a mission post as your main character or any other character or protected non-playing character associated with your account.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about Nova is how flexible it is. The system doesn't limit how many characters can be involved with a post. A single dropdown menu presents you with a list of characters available for use in the post. At the top of the list are all your characters, then all playing characters, then all NPCs that are linked with a player and finally all unlinked NPCs.</p>

<p>There are several ways to include a character in a post. If you want to post an entry with a single character, simply select the character from the list, write your post and click Post or Save. Nova will save the item in the database and you'll be good to go. If you want to write a post with multiple characters, the process is similar: select the character from the dropdown list then click Add Author to the right of the dropdown. The character will be added to a list below the dropdown menu. Select another character and do the same thing. If you do happen to forget to click Add Author for the last character, Nova will automatically use the item you selected from the dropdown.</p>

<p>Similarly easy is the process of removing characters from a post. Simply click on the minus icon to the left and they'll disappear from the list. You need to save the post or post it for the changes to be reflected in the database.</p>

<p>Nova uses a mission notes feature to give players information they need to know before posting. There is a setting for whether or not you want to use mission notes in the Settings page. It is set to yes by default.</p>

<p>The email players will receive has the authors, the subject, the timeline, the location and the message. If someone has chosen not to receive email notifications of mission posts they will have to manually look through mission posts the next time they login to Nova. In the event that more than 1 of a user's characters are listed, the first of their characters in the author field will be used for determining which character the post comes from.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>In order to write a mission post, a user needs <kbd>write/missionpost</kbd> privileges.</p>

<h2>Saving Posts</h2>

<p>Mission posts can be saved so that you can work on them for a little while then come back to it later on. This is especially advantageous with joint author posts. In order to save a mission post, you only need to have an author set and you can click Save. Your saved mission posts will show up in your list of saved posts.</p>

<h2>Deleting Posts</h2>

<p>You can only delete a mission post from the write pages if it's in the saved status. If you decide you don't want to do a mission post that you've already saved, just click Delete and it will be deleted. After deleting the saved mission post, you will be redirected to the Admin Control Panel after 5 seconds.</p>
