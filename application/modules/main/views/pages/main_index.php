<h1>Welcome to AnodyneDocs</h1>

<p>Beginning with Nova, Anodyne is committed to providing the best possible documentation for our products. We've gone to great lengths to make that goal happen with an exhaustive user guide for our newest product. While the SMS documentation program never got off the ground, we do provide a limited user guide with answers to commonly asked question and some tutorials on using the system. If you have questions about the documentation or would like to report typos or incorrect information, please <a href="http://anodyne-productions.com/index.php?cat=main&page=contact" target="_blank">contact Anodyne</a>.</p>

	<em>Nova 2 is the continued evolution of Anodyne's flagship product. Building on the success of Nova 1, this second version is the culmination of what we've learned in the years since starting work on Nova 2. While not complete with lots of flashy new features, Nova 2 finally makes the jump to PHP 5 only and a new file structure that makes updating to new features a breeze. This user guide is your one-stop-shop to all things Nova 2. <strong>Note:</strong> Nova 2 is still under heavy development and constantly changing, so all material in this section should be considered beta and subject to change before Nova 2's final release.</em>

	<span>SMS 2</span>
	<em>In 2005, Anodyne took the simming world by storm with the release of SMS 1.2, an easy to use RPG management tool that catapulted us to the forefront of RPG management. Over the course of 3 years, Anodyne continued to improve and update SMS to make it the premier RPG management tool. This limited user guide will answer commonly asked questions and provide some tutorials for working with SMS. <strong>Note:</strong> SMS 2 is no longer being actively developed and is scheduled to be phased out. We recommed upgrading to Nova as soon as possible.</em>
